Bricks.js

* TODO All constants can be in a separate file.

* TODO Line Number---> 12   Paddle can be assigned a top attribute instead of bottom which will make it easier to test the collision and also consistency will be obtained.

* TODO Line Number---> 26   The names topVelocity and leftVelocity does not make sense, as a object can have only one velocity.

* TODO Handling collisions of the ball with paddle, wall seems to be a work of the game(If we make a Game class). If we make it a work of the ball, then it needs to have the information of walls, paddle, bricks.

* TODO Class World does not seem to be needed, because it does not have any behavior.

* TODO Magic numbers are there on line numbers : 49, 56, 60.
